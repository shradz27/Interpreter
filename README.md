# Interpreter
Simple assignment interpreter 

Run following command to start the interpreter. 

     python Assignment.py

Above command starts the interpreter. Interpreter starts to work when user gives valid assignment syntax. For invalid syntax, the interpreter prints "error" and terminates. 
With current setup, Interpreter infinitely processes the given syntax one after another if valid until the it is killed.
Every time the assignment is complete, the variable is saved in the global scope so that same variables can be used for later
syntax.
